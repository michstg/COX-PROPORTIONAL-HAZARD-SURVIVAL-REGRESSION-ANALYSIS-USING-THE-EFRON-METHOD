#  Regresi cox proportional hazard dengan estimasi parameter efron
Dataset = COVID-19 patient in Adam Malik Hospital

* Y = time survival
* X1 = age
* X2 = vitamin
* X3 = Levofloxacin Antibiotics
* X4 = censored status

The best model formed in proportional hazard cox regression uses the Efron method with backward elimination

Summary = Patients who were given vitamins had a hazard ratio of 0.6735 times faster to be hospitalized and recovered than patients who were not given vitamins.
